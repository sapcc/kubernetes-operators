# Openstack Seeder

Seed your openstack content with a kubernetes operator.

- introduces a new kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition **openstackseed**
    - **kubectl get openstackseeds** lists all deployed openstack seeds
    - kubectl apply/delete can be used to maintain openstack seed specs
- the k8s openstack-seeder watches the lifecycle events of these specs
- openstack seed specs can depend on another (hierarchy) 
- on a lifecycle event of a seed spec (only create/update), the operator resolves 
  the dependencies of the specs (merges them) and invokes the seeding of the 
  merged seed spec
- works with > k8s version 1.15
Seeding currently only supports creating or updating of entities (upserts).

## Spec format
    
The seeding content can be provided in the usual kubernets spec yaml format.

The exact specfification of the seed format can be found in the pkg/seeder/apis/v1/types go doc.    
    
Example seed spec of a keystone seed to be deployed via helm:
    
    apiVersion: "openstack.stable.sap.cc/v1"
    kind: "OpenstackSeed"
    metadata:
      name: keystone-seed
      labels:
        app: {{ template "fullname" . }}
        chart: "{{ .Chart.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Version }}"
        release: "{{ .Release.Name }}"
        heritage: "{{ .Release.Service }}"

## why did you not use gophercloud as a go openstack client?

When we started the implementation of the operator, the gophercloud api coverage was far from complete.
Hence we decided to spawn a python seeder that does the actual seeding via the python opensatck api clients.
