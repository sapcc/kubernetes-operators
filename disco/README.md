# Designate IngresS Cname Operator (DISCO)

[![Docker Repository](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/sapcc/disco.svg?maxAge=604800)](https://hub.docker.com/r/sapcc/disco/)

The DISCO operator automatically discovers Ingresses in the Kubernetes cluster and creates corresponding CNAMEs in OpenStack Desginate.

## Features

- Discovers required CNAMEs via Kubernetes API
- Automatically creates CNAMEs via OpenStack Designate API
- Periodically verifies CNAMEs
- Automatically deletes CNAMEs when the Ingress is deleted
- Exposes Prometheus metrics

## Requirements

- go 1.18

## Installation

The [helm chart](https://github.com/sapcc/helm-charts/tree/master/system/kube-system/charts/disco/) can be used to bring the DISCO to your cluster.  
Note that the DISCO will only start for Ingresses that are annotated with
```
metadata:
  annotations:
    disco: "true"
```

## Configuration

The DISCO is configured via environment variables:
```
# Openstack configurations.
OS_AUTH_URL:
OS_REGION_NAME:
OS_USERNAME:
OS_PASSWORD:
OS_USER_DOMAIN_NAME:
OS_PROJECT_NAME:
OS_PROJECT_DOMAIN_NAME:

# Operator specifics.
DEFAULT_DNS_ZONE_NAME:
DEFAULT_DNS_RECORD:
```

## Usage

Given the following Ingress
```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    disco: "true"
  
... 
 
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myhost.zone.tld
    ...
```
the operator would create the following CNAME in the configured zone in OpenStack Designate
```
+-----------------------+-------+----------------+
| name                  | type  | records        |
+------------------------------------------------+
| myhost.zone.tld.      | CNAME | <record>       |
+-----------------------+-------+----------------+
```

Given the following service:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata
  annotations:
    disco: "true"
    disco/record: myhost.zone.tld.
spec:
  externalIPs:
  - 1.2.3.4
  loadBalancerIP: 1.2.3.4
  ...
status:
  loadBalancer:
    ingress:
    - ip: 1.2.3.4
```

the operator would create the following A record in the configured zone in OpenStack Designate
```
+-----------------------+-------+----------------+
| name                  | type  | records        |
+------------------------------------------------+
| myhost.zone.tld.      | A     | 1.2.3.4        |
+-----------------------+-------+----------------+
```

**Fine-tuning:**

The operator has to be configured with a default record.
However, this can also be set on the ingress using the following annotation:
```
disco/record: < record >
```

Per default type of all records will be `CNAME`.
This can be set to one of `A`, `SOA`, `NS`, `CNAME` using the following annotation:
```
disco/record-type: <record type>
```

Moreover, a description can be provided via the annotation:
```
disco/record-description: < description >
``` 

Creation of records in a different zone is supported via the annotation:
```
disco/zone-name: <name of the zone>
```

All parameters and their defaults:
```
Usage of disco:
      --config string               Path to operator config file (default "/etc/disco/disco.conf")
      --debug                       Enable debug logging
      --ingress-annotation string   Handle ingress with this annotation (default "disco")
      --service-annotation string   Handle service with this annotation (default "disco")
      --kubeconfig string           Path to kubeconfig file with authorization and master location information
      --metric-port int             Metrics are exposed on this port (default 9091)
      --recheck-period int          RecheckPeriod[min] defines the base period after which configmaps are checked again (default 5)
      --record string               Default record data used for the CNAME
      --recordset-ttl int           The Recordset TTL in seconds (default 1800)
      --resync-period int           ResyncPeriod[min] defines the base period after which the cache is resynced (default 2)
      --threadiness int             The operator threadiness (default 1)
      --zone-name string            Name of the openstack zone in which the recordset will be created
```

**Note**:
The DISCO operator uses [finalizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/custom-resources/custom-resource-definitions/#finalizers)
to ensure the deletion of Designate CNAMEs when the deletion of the corresponding ingress is triggered.
Removing the finalizer manually will cause a left-over CNAME in Designate.

## Limitations

If an Ingress defines multiple hosts, as shown below, deleting one rule will currently not trigger the deletion of the record in Designate.
```
spec:
  rules:
  - host: party.subdomain.tld
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: party-service
          servicePort: 80
        path: /
  - host: disco.subdomain.tld
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: disco-service
          servicePort: 80
        path: /
```

## Getting Started

Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/disco:tag
```
	
3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/disco:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`
